# Aeon MarkFlow — Build Brief for Claude Code

Working context for building **Aeon MarkFlow**, Aeon Synergies' sales & marketing engagement platform. Companion to **Aeon Onboard** (`AeonSynergies/aeon-onboard`, `AeonSynergies/aeon-onboard-backend`) — currently being cloned and migrated from Vercel (internal-testing only, no live data) to the same new AWS account MarkFlow will live in, with schema additions layered on top rather than a rewrite.

Full reasoning for every decision below lives in the project's 27-section requirements doc — ask for it if something here needs more depth.

## What this app is

MarkFlow owns everything **before** a deal is priced: Leads, the marketing/engagement workflow engine (email/call/SMS sequences), and Discovery call management. The moment a Discovery Meeting is scheduled and marked "Interested," a Deal hands off to Aeon Onboard, which owns pricing, contracts, payment, and client management from there. MarkFlow never touches pricing, contracts, or billing.

## Repos, backend separation, and shared auth

- `aeon-markflow` (frontend) / `aeon-markflow-backend` (backend) — separate repos, deliberately, so future hires can get frontend-only or backend-only access cleanly (GitHub has no folder-level access control within one repo).
- **MarkFlow and Onboard are two separate backend services, not a shared backend** — isolates MarkFlow's inherent volatility (new third-party integrations, active iteration) from Onboard's stability once it's handling real payments/contracts, and preserves the same future-access-separation logic as the repo split.
- **Shared identity without a shared backend**: both services validate JWTs signed with the same secret (or share one `Users`/`UserAccessGrant` collection in the same MongoDB cluster). One login, no live inter-service call needed for auth.
- **The only network calls between the two services**: the Handoff event (MarkFlow → Onboard, routine) and the Lost+Recycle event (Onboard → MarkFlow, rare) — both deliberate business-logic boundaries, not incidental coupling.
- Mitigate frontend/backend contract drift with a shared types package or checked-in OpenAPI spec once more than one person is working across that boundary.

## Stack

- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/Radix + TanStack Query (matches Onboard)
- Backend: Node.js + Express 5 + TypeScript + Mongoose/MongoDB + JWT/bcrypt + Swagger (matches Onboard)
- New for MarkFlow: `@xyflow/react` (workflow builder canvas), BullMQ + Redis (job queue), `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (AI generation), Microsoft Graph client + `googleapis` + axios-based Zoho wrapper (email adapters)
- Hosting (when ready to deploy, not needed for local dev): new AWS account (shared with Onboard) — App Runner (backend), S3 + CloudFront (frontend), MongoDB Atlas, ElastiCache/Upstash (Redis), Secrets Manager

## Core entities (Mongoose-shaped)

```
Contact        — shared across orgs: email, phone, firmographics (dsp_code, drivers, vans, stations),
                 global_do_not_contact (hard suppress override)
Lead           — one per (Contact, Organization): status enum (NEW-COLD, NEW-INBOUND, CONTACTED,
                 CONTACTED-PHONE, CONTACTED-EMAIL, PROSPECT, INACTIVE, RECLAIMED), email_deliverability
                 (GOOD/LOW/BAD), phone_dnd_status, org_id, recycled_from_deal_id, lost_reason, lost_stage,
                 eligible_for_reengagement_at
SavedList      — reusable lead segments, decoupled from any one workflow
Organization   — name, enabled_features[], product_context, brand_voice_guidelines_id, sending_domains[]
                 (an org can have multiple sending domains — Aeon Miles sometimes sends from the Aeon
                 Synergies domain — never assume 1:1 org-to-domain)
WorkflowTemplate — org-scoped, requires_warmup flag, steps[] (email | call_task | sms | wait)
Enrollment     — Lead × WorkflowTemplate instance: current step, status (active/paused/completed/exited)
EmailTemplate  — org-scoped, ab_group_id, current_version_id
EmailTemplateVersion — subject_line, body_html, image_blocks[], image_policy (always/never/auto),
                 generation_source (ai/human/ai_edited_by_human), ai_draft_snapshot,
                 status (DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED | REJECTED → RESUBMITTED),
                 ai_generation_metadata { reference_templates[], reason }
ReviewTask     — auto-created when a template/workflow change needs human approval
LeadActivity   — kind: email | call | sms | meeting | task | note; links lead_id, workflow enrollment + step
SendTimePerformance — rollup: org_id, workflow_type, persona, day_of_week, hour_bucket, timezone_bucket,
                 content_variant_id, sent_count, reply_rate, meeting_rate, sample_size
UserAccessGrant — { user_id, app: "markflow"|"onboard", org_id (null = all orgs), role, features[] }
```

## The three things that must never be violated

1. **"Response rate" means reply rate / meeting-booked, never open rate**, anywhere in analytics or optimization logic. Opens are unreliable (Apple MPP, Gmail proxy caching).
2. **Human-in-the-loop gates are real gates**: AI-generated template content and AI-suggested workflow/optimization changes sit in `DRAFT`/`PENDING_APPROVAL` until a human with the right role approves — never auto-applied. Exception: sending guardrails (domain warmup/throttling) can act autonomously — safety mechanism, not a content/strategy judgment call.
3. **A `WorkflowStep` pins to a specific `email_template_version_id`, never "latest."** Editing a template must never silently change a sequence already enrolling leads.

## RBAC, condensed

| Role | MarkFlow access |
|---|---|
| Super Admin / Admin | Full, all orgs |
| BD Admin | Full |
| BD Manager | Full lead + workflow access |
| BD-Lead Gen | Upload/monitor leads only — no workflow, no email/call access |
| BD-Sales | Full workflow access (build, run) |

Recycled/Win-back lead segment visible to: BD-Sales, BD-Manager, Admin only.

## Integration points and current status

| Integration | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft 365 (Aeon Synergies domain) | Credentials pending | Graph API, app-only Mail.Send/Mail.Read |
| Google Workspace (Aeon Miles domain) | Credentials pending | Domain-wide delegation, Gmail API |
| Zoho Mail (Aeon Sign, Aeon Scheduler domains) | Credentials pending | OAuth app + refresh token |
| Zoom Phone SMS | Credentials pending | `POST /v2/phone/sms/messages` confirmed to exist; verify plan tier |
| Aeon Scheduler | URL-only for now | "Discovery Meeting Scheduled" is an abstract event — Phase 1 raises it manually; swap in the webhook later without redesigning anything downstream |
| Aeon Sign | Not needed for MarkFlow | Onboard-only integration |
| GA4 / Microsoft Clarity | Deliberately deferred | Revisit only if templates start linking to marketing pages instead of direct booking/reply actions |

## Build order

1. **Foundation**: `Organization` entity, `org_id` scoping, `Contact`/`Lead` split, `UserAccessGrant` model — pure schema work, only needs a MongoDB connection
2. **Email sending infrastructure**: multi-provider adapters (Graph/Google/Zoho), domain routing, click-tracking redirects — no AI yet
3. **AI template assistant**: draft → `EmailTemplateVersion` → human review gate, grounded in Brand Voice guidelines + Winning Email Library (seed from the Aeon Sign/Aeon Miles templates already provided) + Lead's own thread for replies
4. **Visual workflow builder** (React Flow) + enrollment engine, tied to approved template versions
5. **Domain warmup + AI sending guardrails**
6. **AI analytics/optimization + A/B testing**: diagnosis-by-symptom (bounce → deliverability, not content; low opens → subject line; opened-no-click → body; clicks-no-reply → CTA/timing)
7. **Send-time/content-pattern optimization**: configurable manual/ai_suggested/ai_automatic, always subordinate to the guardrail service
8. **Multi-org rollout**: image-placeholder policy, cross-org insight sharing (abstracted patterns only)

## Seed material available

Six uploaded documents contain real, in-voice templates for Aeon Sign and Aeon Miles — seed the Brand Voice guidelines and Winning Email Library from these rather than generating from scratch. Aeon Sign: persona-segmented sequences (Amazon DSP/AFP, FedEx ISP, Other Logistics), Day 1→3→7→14→21/28 cadence, product story "Send → Collect → Track → Store." Aeon Miles: mixed-channel sequence (Email→Email→Call→Email→Email→Call) with exit-condition and win-back logic already built into the human playbook. No existing material for Aeon RecruitPro or Aeon Scheduler — cold start for those.

## Org product context

- **Aeon Miles**: Amazon DSP back-office suite (payroll, bookkeeping, disputes, analytics, dispatch, recruitment). Sub-brands: Aeon Finance, Aeon Fleet, Aeon Flow.
- **Aeon Sign**: e-signature/document workflow — logistics HR documentation for DSP/FedEx ISP operators, broader contract/approval use case for other logistics companies.
- **Aeon RecruitPro**: standalone generic recruitment/ATS platform — genuinely separate market from Aeon Miles despite internal fulfillment overlap.
- **Aeon Scheduler**: Calendly-style scheduling SaaS with built-in payment collection.
